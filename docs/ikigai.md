Personal thoughts for [Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39995046-ikigai)

## Review

![Ikigai](/img/docs/ikigai.jpeg)

I found the book's cover illustration captivating. Sadly, I can't say I felt the same for the rest of the book. While the authors did introduce numerous interesting concepts, they did not explore the concepts in a depth which was meaningful. Instead, they jumped far too quickly from one concept to another, covering each concept superficially. As such, the book felt like a list of fun facts. It was a pity given how many concepts introduced could have been starters for insightful discourse.

That being said, I still penned a personal reflection on the book. That's because parts of it were still thought provoking for me. In this document, you'll find some of these thoughts. They are the ones I am comfortable sharing. They are also my biggest takeaways from the book.

## Reason for being

- In Okinawa, a blue zone, there is no word for retirement.

> "Blue Zones are regions of the world where a higher than usual number of people live much longer than average." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Zone)

- Instead, they have **Ikigai** which loosely translates to the reason for which you wake up in the morning.
- Ikigai is at the intersection of what you love, what the world needs, what you can be paid for, and what you are good at.
- _I am grateful I found my Ikigai - writing software for computers, early in my life, back when I was 14._
- _I am also thankful I get to develop my other passion - which is to write for humans, on this website._
- Having an Ikigai, a reason for being, a why for living, is parmount in living a meaningful life:

> "He who has a _why_ to live for can bear with almost any _how_." - Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher who has a profound influence on modern intellectual history

- _If we ever feel overwhelmed, chances are we might have lost sight of our *why*._

> "Why do you not commit suicide?" - Viktor Frankl, an Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist, philosopher, author, and Holocaust survivor who founded logotherapy

- _It is also important to always be conscious about why we choose to live day after day._
- _Reading this reminded me of the following quote:_

> "Memento Mori" - Latin for "remember you must die"

- _Knowing that we must die one day, why do we still do what we do?_

## Living in the present

- We should enjoy the present, and not lose ourselves in worries about the past or the future.

> “Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift… that’s why they call it the present.” – Master Oogway from Kungfu Panda
>
> "The only moment in which you can be truly alive is the present moment." - Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk
>
> "一期一会/Ichi-go ichi-e" - Japanese for "one time, one meeting" or "this moment exists only now and won't come again"

- We should embrace our feelings: we don't create them; they simply come to us; and we have to accept them.

> "Hello, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with me, and I will care for you." - Thich Nhat Hanh.

- We must avoid attempting to eliminate negative feelings; instead, we should focus on the present moment, as recovery will come on its own eventually.
- _But we must be mindful to not let negative thoughts spiral out of control._
- _Reading that reminded me of [Mark Manson's Feedback Loop from Hell](https://markmanson.net/feedback-loop-from-hell)_.

## Having the right attitude

- We should live like the locals in Ogimi, a village in Okinawa known as the Village of Longevity - they are always busy with meaningful tasks but did everything with a sense of calm, and never in a rush.
- _We all have to face difficult times in life, we don't get a say in that, but we can choose what attitude we have and what we do in those moments._
- _We also need to remember that **this too shall pass**, and sometimes all we have to do is persevere a little longer._

> "This too shall pass." - A Persian adage which reflects on the temporary nature of all things human
>
> "頑張る/Ganbaru." - Japanese for "to persevere" and "to stand firm"

- Resilience isn't just about the ability to persevere, but also to stay focused on the important things in life.
- It is important not to get swept up with negative emotions and lose sight of what truly matters.

## Discipline over motivation

- Shoma Morita, a psychotherapist who founded Morita therapy - a branch of clinical psychology strongly influenced by Zen Buddhism, believes that **feelings will change as a result of your actions.**
- _This is echoed in [Mark Manson's How to Get Motivated and Take Action](https://markmanson.net/how-to-get-motivated) too:_

> "Action isn’t just the effect of motivation, but also the cause of it." - Mark Manson, an American self-help author and blogger

- _It is important that we rely on discipline rather than motivation. We have control over the former, but never the latter._

## Life is not a solvable problem

- _The concluding paragraph of the book resonated deeply with me. It embodies what I want to live by moving forward:_

> "Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you."

- _Being able to pursue my Ikigai while surrounded by cherished ones is really all I need in this life, besides the lowest tiers of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)._
